This dataset is designed for fault detection in gas turbine engines using 
machine learning techniques. It contains 1,386 samples with sensor readings 
and operational parameters collected from a simulated gas turbine system. 
The dataset can be used to develop and optimize classification models for 
predictive maintenance and fault diagnosis.

Key Features
Temperature (°C) – Turbine inlet temperature.
RPM – Rotational speed of the turbine.
Torque (Nm) – Force applied to the turbine shaft.
Vibrations (mm/s) – Mechanical vibration intensity.
Power Output (MW) – Generated power output.
Fuel Flow Rate (kg/s) – Rate of fuel consumption.
Air Pressure (kPa) – Air intake and exhaust pressure.
Exhaust Gas Temperature (°C) – Heat measurement at the exhaust.
Oil Temperature (°C) – Temperature of lubricating oil.
Fault – Binary classification (0 = No Fault, 1 = Fault).
Use Cases
Predictive maintenance in gas turbines.
Machine learning model optimization for fault classification.
Performance analysis and anomaly detection in industrial machinery.
